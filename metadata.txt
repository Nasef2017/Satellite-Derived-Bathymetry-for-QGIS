about=<h3>SDB Master Workflow: The Ultimate User Guide</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Introduction: What is this Tool?</h4>
        <p>The <b>SDB Master Workflow</b> is a powerful and integrated tool for <b>QGIS</b> designed to fully automate the process of <b>Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB)</b>. Instead of manually testing different algorithms, this tool acts as an "automated expert," intelligently running a comprehensive suite of <b>machine learning</b> models, comparing their performance, selecting the best one for your specific data, and producing a final, high-quality depth map—all in a single click.</p>
        <p>This workflow follows the best practices recommended by international bodies like the <b>International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)</b> and empowers you to derive accurate bathymetry from satellite imagery efficiently and reliably.</p>
        
        <h4>2. The Automated Workflow Explained</h4>
        The tool follows a logical, four-stage pipeline:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Pre-processing and Smart Water Masking:</b> The tool automatically calculates a water index (<b>MNDWI</b> or <b>NDWI</b>) and applies morphological cleaning to create a high-quality, "clean," water-only version of your satellite image. All subsequent analyses are performed exclusively on this masked image.</li>
            <li><b>Algorithm Comparison and Hyperparameter Tuning:</b> For each selected algorithm, the tool performs a <b>Smart Search (Bayesian Optimization)</b> to discover the optimal settings (<b>hyperparameters</b>) for your specific data before training the final model.</li>
            <li><b>Post-processing with Median Filter (Optional):</b> If enabled, the tool applies a <b>Median Filter</b> to every raw depth map to remove "salt-and-pepper" noise, resulting in smoother and more realistic outputs.</li>
            <li><b>Evaluation and the Decision Engine:</b> Each model is rigorously tested against your <b>Unseen Test Points</b>. A <b>Final Score</b> is calculated (70% weight for <b>R²</b>, 30% for <b>RMSE</b>) to objectively rank the models. The tool generates a master report and automatically loads the raster from the winning algorithm into QGIS.</li>
        </ol>
