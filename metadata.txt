description=A comprehensive and automated toolkit for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) using machine learning.

about=<h3>SDB Master Workflow</h3> <p>The SDB Master Workflow is a powerful QGIS tool that automates Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) processing. It combines preprocessing, algorithm testing, objective ranking of models, and automated reporting. The tool is designed for both scientific research and practical applications in hydrography and coastal engineering. It follows international recommendations (IHO) and supports reproducible and efficient workflows.</p> <p><b>Workflow Stages:</b><br> 1. Pre-processing and smart water masking (MNDWI/NDWI + morphological cleaning).<br> 2. Algorithm comparison with hyperparameter tuning (Bayesian Optimization).<br> 3. Optional median filtering to reduce noise.<br> 4. Evaluation using test points with weighted scoring (70%% RÂ², 30%% RMSE).</p> <p><b>References:</b><br> - IHO Publication B-13: Cookbook for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (<a href="https://iho.int/">IHO website</a>)<br> - Stumpf et al.
